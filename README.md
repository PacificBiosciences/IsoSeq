***

*IsoSeq v3* contains the newest tools to identify transcripts in
PacBio single-molecule sequencing data.
Starting in SMRT Link v6.0.0, those tools power the
*IsoSeq GUI-based analysis* application.
A composable workflow of existing tools and algorithms, combined with
a new clustering technique, allows to process the ever-increasing yield of PacBio
machines with similar performance to *IsoSeq* versions 1 and 2.
Starting with version 3.4, support for UMI and cell barcode based deduplication
has been added.

## Availability
