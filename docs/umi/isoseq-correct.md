## Barcode Correction Documentation

### Why Barcode Correction?

Single-cell, spatially-resolved, and other barcoded sequencing applications
rely on the accuracy of the cell or group barcode, which is typically chosen from a set of
known candidates, often referred to as a "whitelist".

This contrasts with the uniformly randomly-generated molecular barcodes (a.k.a. UMIs, "Unique molecular identifiers").

This tool uses the set of known candidates to correct sequencing errors in cell barcode identification. There are two primary benefits:

1. Increased yield
2. Improved accuracy in downstream deduplication.

By correcting errors in cell barcodes, the total number of usable reads is increased (typically ~5%).

And, once cell barcodes are corrected, the downstream groupdedup software tool can perform deduplication much more efficiently
than standard deduplication. This is because only reads sharing a cell barcode are compared, which dramatically reduces the search space compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons.

### What does Barcode Correction do?

First, the *correct* tool builds a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) index over the 10x whitelist barcode subsequences.
In the second step, *correct* uses the LSH index to map raw input barcodes to their nearest barcodes in the truth-set.

For each input HiFI read containing a 10x cell barcode:
 -  If the barcode is in the whitelist, it is unchanged.
 -  If the barcode is not found in the whitelist, the index is queried for the closest match in the whitelist.
 -  Edit distance is calculated between all retrieved whitelist cell barcodes and the input barcode.
 -  The barcode with the lowest edit distance and lowest hamming distance is output.
 -  By default, if the edit distance between the cell barcode and whitelist barcode is > 2, the read is marked as failing.
 -  If no candidates were found, the barcode is unchanged, and the read is marked as failing.

In addition, "real cells" will be marked with `rc` tag after this step, which will be used by `isoseq3 groupdedup`.

### When would a user call this tool?

Run this tool on barcode-tagged BAM files before deduplication (`isoseq3 groupdedup`).
This provides substantial runtime improvements compared to `isoseq3 dedup`.

## Usage

### (with barcode-set in barcodes.txt)
```
isoseq3 correct --barcodes barcodes.txt[.gz] input.bam output.bam
```

Common single-cell whitelist (e.g. 10x whitelist for 3' kit) can be found in the [MAS-Seq dataset](https://downloads.pacbcloud.com/public/dataset/MAS-Seq/).


#### Tags
This requires the existance of XC and XU barcode tags.
The program will fail if either are missing.

We also add or update the following tags:


| Tag | Type | Short Name | Relevant Executable | Value |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | ----- | ----- |
|CR| string  | Cell Barcode  | `correct` | Raw (uncorrected) cell barcode |
|CB| string  | Cell Barcode  | `correct` | Corrected cell barcode |
|XC| string  | Cell Barcode | `tag`, `correct` | Raw cell barcode |
|nc| int     | Number of Candidates | `correct` | Number of candidate barcodes. |
|oc| string  | Other Choices | `correct` | String representation of other potential barcodes. |
|gp| int     | Group Passes | `correct` | Flag specifying whether or not the barcode for the given read passes filters. 1 for passing, 0 for failing. |
|nb| int     | Barcode Distance | `correct` | Edit distance from the barcode for the read to the barcode to which it was reassigned. This is 0 if the barcode matches exactly, -1 if the barcode could not be rescued, and the edit distance otherwise. |
|rc| int     | Real Cell | `correct` | Predicted real cell. This is 1 if a read is predicted to come from a real cell and 0 if predicted to be a non-real cell. |
