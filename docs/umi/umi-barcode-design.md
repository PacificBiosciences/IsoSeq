## UMI/Barcode designs

Following schematic explains how Iso-Seq supports single-cell tags:

The tool of choice to clip tags (cell barcode, UMI, Gs), is `isoseq tag`.
It supports design presets and custom experimental designs.
Tags are abbreviated with a single character with optional length.

`T` indicates the transcript position and is mandatory.
It is the anchor to determine if tags are located on the 3' or 5' side.\
`U` as in UMI must be preceeded by the length of the UMI.\
`B` as in cell barcode must be preceed by the length of the cell barcode.\
`G` is a special PacBio 5' UMI tag with a `GGG` suffix.\
`X` must be must be preceeded by the length of an extra sequence to clip
such as a TSO sequence.

Let's explain by example, the `Example A` design of 8bp UMI 5' and 12bp barcode 5'
can be specified with this string:

    T-8U-12B

Tags are concatenated with hypens.

Similarly, the `Example B`design:

    T-10U-16B

The `Example C` design for a 8bp UMI 5' with a fixed 3G UMI is:

    8G-T

If you have a custom experiment, combine any of those tags uniquely, for example
the a 6bp UMI 5' and a 13bp barcode 3':

    6U-T-13U
