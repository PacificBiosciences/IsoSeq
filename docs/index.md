***

*Iso-Seq* contains the newest tools to identify transcripts in PacBio
single-molecule sequencing data. Starting in SMRT Link v6.0.0, those tools power
the *Iso-Seq GUI-based analysis* application. A composable workflow of existing
tools and algorithms, combined with a new clustering technique, allows to
process the ever-increasing yield of PacBio. Starting with version 3.4, support
for UMI and cell barcode based deduplication has been added.

## Availability
Latest version can be installed via bioconda package `isoseq3`.
